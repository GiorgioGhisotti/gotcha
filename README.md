Description
---

Gotcha is an Android app that finds and extracts objects from pictures, allowing the user to export the resulting image as a png file. It uses OpenCV deep neural networks to distinguish objects and the GrabCut algorithm to extract objects accurately.

### Examples

![example0](img/example0.jpg?raw=true "Example 0")\
![example1](img/example1.jpg?raw=true "Example 1")\
![example2](img/example2.jpg?raw=true "Example 2")\
![example3](img/example3.jpg?raw=true "Example 3")\
![example4](img/example4.jpg?raw=true "Example 4")\
![example5](img/example5.jpg?raw=true "Example 5")\
![example6](img/example6.jpg?raw=true "Example 6")
