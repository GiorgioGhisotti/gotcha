# gotcha

## What's this?
Gotcha is an Android app that finds and extracts objects from pictures, allowing the user to export the resulting image as a png file. It uses OpenCV deep neural networks to distinguish objects and the GrabCut algorithm to extract objects accurately.

Examples:\
![example0](img/example0.jpg?raw=true "Example 0")\
![example1](img/example1.jpg?raw=true "Example 1")\
![example2](img/example2.jpg?raw=true "Example 2")\
![example3](img/example3.jpg?raw=true "Example 3")\
![example4](img/example4.jpg?raw=true "Example 4")\
![example5](img/example4.jpg?raw=true "Example 5")\
![example6](img/example4.jpg?raw=true "Example 6")\

## How can I build and run it?
To run this you'll need to install the OpenCV Manager app on your phone.

Minimum SDK: 21

To build this project you'll need the OpenCV-android-sdk folder in the root directory of the project. You can also modify the CMakeLists.txt file to use a different path.
